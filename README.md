This is Default Redone. There are a lot of features in this resource pack. Too many features to list... The screenshots show very little compared to everything in the pack, so you should check it out yourself!

This resource pack uses assets from other resource packs, but also uses original assets made by myself. Most if not all assets in this pack not created by me are either from Minecraft, or edited in some way by me.

## Notes
### [Optifine is Required (For Now)](https://optifine.net/downloads)

Use SEUS/Old PBR Material format.

## Notice
![image](https://github.com/RyanCR03/Default-Redone/blob/main/defredv5.png)

(<b>Project Postponed Until Further Notice</b>) The newest major update will be a major update to the resource pack since it will include the removal of assets made by other people, official support for Optifine alternatives ([CIT Resewn](https://modrinth.com/mod/cit-resewn), [Entity Texture Features](https://modrinth.com/mod/entitytexturefeatures), [Entity Model Features](https://modrinth.com/mod/entity-model-features), [Animatica](https://modrinth.com/mod/animatica), [Continuity](https://modrinth.com/mod/continuity)), and full support for the Latest Minecraft Version.

This means that Default Redone will no longer have Fresh Animations or Haven. This doesn't mean there won't still be CEM models and animations, it just means they will be much more primitive. Removing Haven assets will also mean I will be remaking all of the wooden style menus. This will not, however include parts of the menus that I have made (which is most of the cool stuff).

After Default Redone V5 is released, I will also be submitting Default Redone to [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com)!

When V5 gets released, if you still find any assets from your resource pack in Default Redone, make sure to submit it to the issues section of the [Default Redone GitHub Page](https://github.com/RyanCR03/Default-Redone/issues).

That's all I have for now. Thanks for reading this announcement!
