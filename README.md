This is Default Redone. There are a lot of features in this resource pack. Too many features to list... The screenshots show very little compared to everything in the pack, so you should check it out yourself!

This resource pack uses assets from other resource packs, but also uses original assets made by myself. Most if not all assets in this pack not created by me are either from Minecraft, or edited in some way by me.

## Notes
